# Poggu-Hud-esx-legacy
This is not my script! The original script is here: https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-poggu-hud-esx-only/840792
I just modified it to work on the new esx(esx_legacy)

# install
Upload this file to your resources folder and ensure it in your server.cfg file (ensure Poggu-Hud)

THIS HUD ONLY WORKS ON ESX
